This a program coded in python for the purpose of changing number to words. 
Files with in this folder:
    readme.txt
    Scanning.py
    Testing.txt
    TestingOutPut.txt
ideally the code would be run in the Scanning.py,
inputs would be stored in Testing and output would be directed to TestingOutPut.
